# Friendbookv2.0

Client-side application building upon FriendBookv1.0 using JavaScript to develop a live-search feature and live tracking using OpenStreetMaps

N.B. 
A directory containing media images used for default profile pictures has been excluded from the upload to protect PII in accordance with GDPR.

This application runs on OpenStreetMaps v2.13.1 as this was the version used during my unversity studies despite it not being the most up-to-date version. It should be noted that if this code is downloaded to be ran, whomever downloads it will also need to download this version of OpenStreetMaps themselves and save it in the root directory of the application for all paths to work. This only affects the mapping and live tracking aspect of the site, all other features should still be operational
